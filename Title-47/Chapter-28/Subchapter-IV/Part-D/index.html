On or before the 1st day of August 1952, and biennially thereafter, the Secretary-Treasurer of the Board shall mail to every professional engineer registered under this part a blank application for biennial renewal of registration, addressing such application to the last-known post-office address. Upon receipt of such application blank, a registrant shall execute and return the application for his biennial registration renewal card to the Board together with the biennial registration renewal fee of $2. Upon receipt of such application and renewal fee the Board shall issue a pocket registration renewal card which shall show the full name and registration number of the registrant, be signed by the Chairman and Secretary-Treasurer of the Board, and state that the person named therein has been granted registration to practice as a professional engineer for the period beginning November 1st in the year of issue and expiring on the 31st day of October in the 2nd year following. Application shall be made biennially on or before the 1st day of November and if not so made an additional fee of $1 for each 30 days delay beyond the 1st day of November, and up to the 1st day of March following shall be added to the current biennial registration renewal fee to be paid upon renewal; to issue a duplicate certificate of registration to replace a certificate lost, destroyed, or mutilated, subject to the rules of the Board, and upon payment of the prescribed fee. The issuance of a certificate of registration by the Board shall be presumptive evidence in all courts and places that the person named therein is entitled to all the rights and privileges of a registered professional engineer while said certificate remains unsuspended, unrevoked, or unexpired;</span>

Code, <a href='/sections/1-207.11.html'>§ 1‑207.11</a>), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act ( D.C. Code, <a href='/sections/1-207.14.html'>§ 1‑207.14(a)</a>), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.</span>
