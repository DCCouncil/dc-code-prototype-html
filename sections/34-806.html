These functions were subsequently transferred to the Director of the Department of Finance and Revenue by Commissioner’s Order No. 69-96, dated March 7, 1969. Functions pertaining to centralized accounting (including approving vouchers) as set forth in that Order were transferred to the Director of the Office of Budget and Financial Management by Organization Order No. 30, dated April 5, 1972.
