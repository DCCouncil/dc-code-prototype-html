                    <span class="" style="">2. Enforcement: In General. The rights of a secured party to enforce its security interest in collateral after the debtor’s default are an important feature of a secured transaction. (Note that the term “rights,” as defined in  Section 1-201, includes “remedies.”) This Part provides those rights as well as certain limitations on their exercise for the protection of the defaulting debtor, other creditors, and other affected persons. However, subsections (a) and (d) make clear that the rights provided in this Part do not exclude other rights provided by agreement.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">3. When Remedies Arise. Under subsection (a) the secured party’s rights arise “[a]fter default.” As did former  <a href='/sections/9-501.html'>Section 9‑501</a>, this Article leaves to the agreement of the parties the circumstances giving rise to a default. This Article does not determine whether a secured party’s post-default conduct can constitute a waiver of default in the face of an agreement stating that such conduct shall not constitute a waiver. Rather, it continues to leave to the parties’ agreement, as supplemented by law other than this Article, the determination whether a default has occurred or has been waived. See  <a href='/sections/1-103.html'>Section 1‑103</a>.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">4. Possession of Collateral;  Section 9-207. After a secured party takes possession of collateral following a default, there is no longer any distinction between a security interest that before default was nonpossessory and a security interest that was possessory before default, as under a common-law pledge. This Part generally does not distinguish between the rights of a secured party with a nonpossessory security interest and those of a secured party with a possessory security interest. However,  Section 9-207 addresses rights and duties with respect to collateral in a secured party’s possession. Under subsection (b) of this section,  Section 9-207 applies not only to possession before default but also to possession after default. Subsection (b) also has been conformed to  Section 9-207, which, unlike former  Section 9-207, applies to secured parties having control of collateral.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">5. Cumulative Remedies. Former  <a href='/sections/9-501.html'>Section 9‑501(1)</a> provided that the secured party’s remedies were cumulative, but it did not explicitly provide whether the remedies could be exercised simultaneously. Subsection (c) permits the simultaneous exercise of remedies if the secured party acts in good faith. The liability scheme of Subpart 2 affords redress to an aggrieved debtor or obligor. Moreover, permitting the simultaneous exercise of remedies under subsection (c) does not override any non-UCC law, including the law of tort and statutes regulating collection of debts, under which the simultaneous exercise of remedies in a particular case constitutes abusive behavior or harassment giving rise to liability.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">6. Judicial Enforcement. Under subsection (a) a secured party may reduce its claim to judgment or foreclose its interest by any available procedure outside this Article under applicable law. Subsection (e) generally follows former  <a href='/sections/9-501.html'>Section 9‑501(5)</a>. It makes clear that any judicial lien that the secured party may acquire against the collateral effectively is a continuation of the original security interest (if perfected) and not the acquisition of a new interest or a transfer of property on account of a preexisting obligation. Under former  <a href='/sections/9-501.html'>Section 9‑501(5)</a>, the judicial lien was stated to relate back to the date of perfection of the security interest. Subsection (e), however, provides that the lien relates back to the earlier of the date of filing or the date of perfection. This provides a secured party who enforces a security interest by judicial process with the benefit of the “first-to-file-or-perfect” priority rule of  <a href='/sections/9-322.html'>Section 9‑322(a)(1)</a>.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">7. Agricultural Liens. Part 6 provides parallel treatment for the enforcement of agricultural liens and security interests. Because agricultural liens are statutory rather than consensual, this Article does draw a few distinctions between these liens and security interests. Under subsection (e), the statute creating an agricultural lien would govern whether and the date to which an execution lien relates back.  <a href='/sections/9-606~P.html'>Section 9‑606</a> explains when a “default” occurs in the agricultural lien context.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">8. Execution Sales. Subsection (f) also follows former  <a href='/sections/9-501.html'>Section 9‑501(5)</a>. It makes clear that an execution sale is an appropriate method of foreclosure contemplated by this Part. However, the sale is governed by other law and not by this Article, and the limitations under  Section 9-610 on the right of a secured party to purchase collateral do not apply.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">9. Sales of Receivables; Consignments. Subsection (g) provides that, except as provided in  <a href='/sections/9-607.html'>Section 9‑607(c)</a>, the duties imposed on secured parties do not apply to buyers of accounts, chattel paper, payment intangibles, or promissory notes. Although denominated “secured parties,” these buyers own the entire interest in the property sold and so may enforce their rights without regard to the seller (“debtor”) or the seller’s creditors. Likewise, a true consignor may enforce its ownership interest under other law without regard to the duties that this Part imposes on secured parties. Note, however, that  Section 9-615 governs cases in which a consignee’s secured party (other than a consignor) is enforcing a security interest that is senior to the security interest (i.e., ownership interest) of a true consignor.</span>
