                    <span class="" style="">2. Consignments. This section takes an approach to consignments similar to that taken by  <a href='/sections/9-318.html'>Section 9‑318</a> with respect to buyers of accounts and chattel paper. Revised  Section 1-201(37) defines “security interest” to include the interest of a consignor of goods under many true consignments.  <a href='/sections/9-319.html'>Section 9‑319(a)</a> provides that, for purposes of determining the rights of certain third parties, the consignee is deemed to acquire all rights and title that the consignor had, if the consignor’s security interest is unperfected. The consignee acquires these rights even though, as between the parties, it purchases a limited interest in the goods (as would be the case in a true consignment, under which the consignee acquires only the interest of a bailee). As a consequence of this section, creditors of the consignee can acquire judicial liens and security interests in the goods.</span>

                <p>
                
                    <span class="" style="">Insofar as creditors of the consignee are concerned, this Article to a considerable extent reformulates the former law, which appeared in former  Sections 2-326 and  9-114, without changing the results. However, neither Article 2 nor former Article 9 specifically addresses the rights of non-ordinary course buyers from the consignee. Former  Section 9-114 contained priority rules applicable to security interests in consigned goods. Under this Article, the priority rules for purchase-money security interests in inventory apply to consignments. See  Section 9-103(d). Accordingly, a special section containing priority rules for consignments no longer is needed.  <a href='/sections/9-317.html'>Section 9‑317</a> determines whether the rights of a judicial lien creditor are senior to the interest of the consignor,  Sections <a href='/sections/9-322.html'>9‑322</a> and  <a href='/sections/9-324.html'>9‑324</a> govern competing security interests in consigned goods, and  Sections <a href='/sections/9-317.html'>9‑317</a>,  <a href='/sections/9-315.html'>9‑315</a>, and  <a href='/sections/9-320.html'>9‑320</a> determine whether a buyer takes free of the consignor’s interest.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">Example 1: SP-1 delivers goods to Debtor in a transaction constituting a “consignment” as defined in  Section 9-102. SP-1 does not file a financing statement. Debtor then grants a security interest in the goods to SP-2. SP-2 files a proper financing statement. Assuming Debtor is a mere bailee, as in a “true” consignment, Debtor would not have any rights in the collateral (beyond those of a bailee) so as to permit SP-2’s security interest to attach to any greater rights. Nevertheless, under this section, for purposes of determining the rights of Debtor’s creditors, Debtor is deemed to acquire SP-1’s rights. Accordingly, SP-2’s security interest attaches, is perfected by the filing, and, under  <a href='/sections/9-322.html'>Section 9‑322</a>, is senior to SP-1’s interest.</span>

SP-1 files a proper financing statement. Debtor then grants a security interest in the goods to SP-2. Under  <a href='/sections/9-322.html'>Section 9‑322</a>, SP-1’s security interest is senior to SP-2’s. Subsection (b) indicates that, for purposes of determining SP-2’s rights, other law determines the rights and title of the consignee. If, for example, a consignee obtains only the special property of a bailee, then SP-2’s security interest would attach only to that special property.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">Example 3: SP-1 obtains a security interest in all Debtor’s existing and after-acquired inventory. SP-1 perfects its security interest with a proper filing. Then SP-2 delivers goods to Debtor in a transaction constituting a “consignment” as defined in  Section 9-102. SP-2 files a proper financing statement but does not send notification to SP-1 under  <a href='/sections/9-324.html'>Section 9‑324(b)</a>. Accordingly, SP-2’s security interest is junior to SP-1’s under  <a href='/sections/9-322.html'>Section 9‑322(a)</a>. Under  <a href='/sections/9-319.html'>Section 9‑319(a)</a>, Debtor is deemed to have the consignor’s rights and title, so that SP-1’s security interest attaches to SP-2’s ownership interest in the goods. Thereafter, Debtor grants a security interest in the goods to SP-3, and SP-3 perfects by filing. Because SP-2’s perfected security interest is senior to SP-3’s under  <a href='/sections/9-322.html'>Section 9‑322(a)</a>,  <a href='/sections/9-319.html'>Section 9‑319(b)</a> applies: Other law determines Debtor’s rights and title to the goods insofar as SP-3 is concerned, and SP-3’s security interest attaches to those rights.</span>
