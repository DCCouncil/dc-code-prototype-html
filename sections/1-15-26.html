                    <span class="" style="">In accordance with <a href='http://openlims.org/public/L4-42.pdf'>D.C. Law 4-42</a>, the &quot;Governmental Reorganization Procedures Act of 1981,&quot; this reorganization will be accomplished by the transfer of certain staff and functions of OBED and OIB to the administrative control of the Assistant City Administrator for Economic Development in OED. I have determined that both offices have so similar operational responsibilities that the District would be best served by a unified administration. Not only will this change clarify administrative roles and responsibilities, but it will also provide a sharper focus to the District&#39;s economic development efforts with the private business sector.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">In summary, economic development and related activities currently being performed separately by the OBED and OIB, both of which promote the District in a local, national, and international arenas, should be merged. The centralization of these activities will diminish fragmented, disjointed, and duplicated service delivery and thus, allow the District to promote its marketing campaign and business services more efficiently and cost-effectively.</span>
