The terms of office of the members of the Apprenticeship Council first appointed by the Mayor shall expire as designated by the Mayor at the time of making the appointment: One representative each of employers, employees and the public being appointed for 1 year; 1 representative each of employers, employees and the public appointed for 2 years; and 1 representative each of employers, employees and the public for 3 years. Thereafter, each member shall be appointed for a term of 3 years.
