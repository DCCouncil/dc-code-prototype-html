                    <span class="" style="">An example of the type of federal statute referred to in subsection (a)(1) is  49 U.S.C. §§ 44107- 11, for civil aircraft of the United States. The Assignment of Claims Act of 1940, as amended, provides for notice to contracting and disbursing officers and to sureties on bonds but does not establish a national filing system and therefore is not within the scope of subsection (a)(1). An assignee of a claim against the United States may benefit from compliance with the Assignment of Claims Act. But regardless of whether the assignee complies with that Act, the assignee must file under this Article in order to perfect its security interest against creditors and transferees of its assignor.</span>

The provision eschews reference to the term “perfection,” inasmuch as  <a href='/sections/9-308.html'>Section 9‑308</a> specifies the meaning of that term and a preemptive rule may use other terminology.</span>

Subsections (a)(2) and (3) exempt from the filing requirements of this Article transactions covered by State certificate-of-title statutes covering motor vehicles and the like. The description of certificate-of-title statutes in subsections (a)(2) and (a)(3) tracks the language of the definition of “certificate of title” in  Section 9-102. For a discussion of the operation of state certificate-of-title statutes in interstate contexts, see the Comments to  <a href='/sections/9-303.html'>Section 9‑303</a>.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">Some states have enacted central filing statutes with respect to secured transactions in kinds of property that are of special importance in the local economy.

                    <span class="" style="">4. Inventory Covered by Certificate of Title. Under subsection (d), perfection of a security interest in the inventory of a person in the business of selling goods of that kind is governed by the normal perfection rules, even if the inventory is subject to a certificate-of-title statute. Compliance with a certificate-of-title statute is both unnecessary and ineffective to perfect a security interest in inventory to which this subsection applies. Thus, a secured party who finances an automobile dealer that is in the business of selling and leasing its inventory of automobiles can perfect a security interest in all the automobiles by filing a financing statement but not by compliance with a certificate-of-title statute.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">Subsection (d), and thus the filing and other perfection provisions of this Article, does not apply to inventory that is subject to a certificate-of-title statute and is of a kind that the debtor is not in the business of selling. For example, if goods are subject to a certificate-of-title statute and the debtor is in the business of leasing but not of selling, goods of that kind, the other subsections of this section govern perfection of a security interest in the goods. The fact that the debtor eventually sells the goods does not, of itself, mean that the debtor “is in the business of selling goods of that kind.”</span>

                    <span class="" style="">5. Compliance with Perfection Requirements of Other Statute. Subsection (b) makes clear that compliance with the perfection requirements (i.e., the requirements for obtaining priority over a lien creditor), but not other requirements, of a statute, regulation, or treaty described in subsection (a) is sufficient for perfection under this Article. Perfection of a security interest under such a statute, regulation, or treaty has all the consequences of perfection under this Article.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">The interplay of this section with certain certificate-of-title statutes may create confusion and uncertainty. For example, statutes under which perfection does not occur until a certificate of title is issued will create a gap between the time that the goods are covered by the certificate under  <a href='/sections/9-303.html'>Section 9‑303</a> and the time of perfection. If the gap is long enough, it may result in turning some unobjectionable transactions into avoidable preferences under  Bankruptcy Code Section 547. (The preference risk arises if more than 10 days (or 20 days, in the case of a purchase-money security interest) passes between the time a security interest attaches (or the debtor receives possession of the collateral, in the case of a purchase-money security interest) and the time it is perfected.) Accordingly, the Legislative Note to this section instructs the legislature to amend the applicable certificate-of-title statute to provide that perfection occurs upon receipt by the appropriate State official of a properly tendered application for a certificate of title on which the security interest is to be indicated.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">Under some certificate-of-title statutes, including the Uniform Motor Vehicle Certificate of Title and Anti-Theft Act, perfection generally occurs upon delivery of specified documents to a state official but may, under certain circumstances, relate back to the time of attachment. This relation-back feature can create great difficulties for the application of the rules in  Sections <a href='/sections/9-303.html'>9‑303</a> and  <a href='/sections/9-311.html'>9‑311(b)</a>. Accordingly, the Legislative Note also recommends to legislatures that they remove any relation-back provisions from certificate-of-title statutes affecting security interests.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">The quoted phrase appeared in former  <a href='/sections/9-302.html'>Section 9‑302(3)</a>. Its meaning was unclear, and many questions arose concerning the extent to which and manner in which Article 9 rules referring to “filing” were applicable to perfection by compliance with a certificate-of-title statute. This Article takes a variety of approaches for applying Article 9’s filing rules to compliance with other statutes and treaties. First, as discussed above in Comment 5, it leaves the determination of some rules, such as the rule establishing time of perfection ( Section 9-516(a)), to the other statutes themselves. Second, this Article explicitly applies some Article 9 filing rules to perfection under other statutes or treaties. See, e.g.,  <a href='/sections/9-505.html'>Section 9‑505</a>. Third, this Article makes other Article 9 rules applicable to security interests perfected by compliance with another statute through the “equivalent to ... filing” provision in the first sentence of  <a href='/sections/9-311.html'>Section 9‑311(b)</a>. The third approach is reflected for the most part in occasional Comments explaining how particular rules apply when perfection is accomplished under  <a href='/sections/9-311.html'>Section 9‑311(b)</a>. See, e.g.,  <a href='/sections/9-310.html'>Section 9‑310</a>, Comment 4;  <a href='/sections/9-315.html'>Section 9‑315</a>, Comment 6;  <a href='/sections/9-317.html'>Section 9‑317</a>, Comment 8. The absence of a Comment indicating that a particular filing provision applies to perfection pursuant to  <a href='/sections/9-311.html'>Section 9‑311(b)</a> does not mean the provision is inapplicable.</span>

This procedure is likely to require the cooperation of the debtor and any competing secured party whose security interest has been noted on the certificate. Comment 4(e) to former  Section 9-103 observed that “that cooperation is not likely to be forthcoming from an owner who wrongfully procured the issuance of a new certificate not showing the out-of-state security interest, or from a local secured party finding himself in a priority contest with the out-of-state secured party.“ According to that Comment, ‘’[t]he only solution for the out-of-state secured party under present certificate of title statutes seems to be to reperfect by possession, i.e., by repossessing the goods.”</span>
