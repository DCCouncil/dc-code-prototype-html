The Mayor may dispose of any solid waste contained in the motor vehicle at the time of seizure and collect up to 3 times the cost and expense incurred for the proper disposal. If it appears to the Mayor that any property seized under this section is liable to perish, waste, or be greatly reduced in value by the keeping, or that the expense of keeping is disproportionate to the value of the property, the Mayor may proceed to advertise and sell the property at auction or otherwise dispose of the property.</span>
