Such a work release privilege may also be granted, in the discretion of the sentencing court or the Director of the Department of Corrections, whenever there exist such special circumstances as merit the granting of the privilege. As used in this subchapter, the word “sentence” and its derivatives shall be construed to include sentencing, imprisonment, and commitment as referred to in this section.</span>
