                    <span class="" style="">1.  <a href='/sections/3-405.html'>Section 3‑405</a> is addressed to fraudulent indorsements made by an employee with respect to instruments with respect to which the employer has given responsibility to the employee. It covers two categories of fraudulent indorsements: indorsements made in the name of the employer to instruments payable to the employer and indorsements made in the name of payees of instruments issued by the employer. This section applies to instruments generally but normally the instrument will be a check.  <a href='/sections/3-405.html'>Section 3‑405</a> adopts the principle that the risk of loss for fraudulent indorsements by employees who are entrusted with responsibility with respect to checks should fall on the employer rather than the bank that takes the check or pays it, if the bank was not negligent in the transaction.  <a href='/sections/3-405.html'>Section 3‑405</a> is based on the belief that the employer is in a far better position to avoid the loss by care in choosing employees, in supervising them, and in adopting other measures to prevent forged indorsements on instruments payable to the employer or fraud in the issuance of instruments in the name of the employer. If the bank failed to exercise ordinary care, subsection (b) allows the employer to shift loss to the bank to the extent the bank’s failure to exercise ordinary care contributed to the loss. “Ordinary care” is defined in  <a href='/sections/3-103.html'>Section 3‑103(a)(7)</a>. The provision applies regardless of whether the employer is negligent.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">The first category of cases governed by  <a href='/sections/3-405.html'>Section 3‑405</a> are those involving indorsements made in the name of payees of instruments issued by the employer. In this category,  <a href='/sections/3-405.html'>Section 3‑405</a> includes cases that were covered by former  <a href='/sections/3-405.html'>Section 3‑405(1)(c)</a>. The scope of  <a href='/sections/3-405.html'>Section 3‑405</a> in revised Article 3 is, however, somewhat wider. It covers some cases not covered by former  <a href='/sections/3-405.html'>Section 3‑405(1)(c)</a> in which the entrusted employee makes a forged indorsement to a check drawn by the employer. An example is Case #6 in Comment 3. Moreover, a larger group of employees is included in revised  <a href='/sections/3-405.html'>Section 3‑405</a>. The key provision is the definition of “responsibility” in subsection (a)(1) which identifies the kind of responsibility delegated to an employee which will cause the employer to take responsibility for the fraudulent acts of that employee. An employer can insure this risk by employee fidelity bonds.</span>

Under former  <a href='/sections/3-406.html'>Section 3‑406</a>, the employer took the loss only if negligence of the employer could be proved. Under revised Article 3,  <a href='/sections/3-406.html'>Section 3‑406</a> need not be used with respect to forgeries of the employer’s indorsement.  <a href='/sections/3-405.html'>Section 3‑405</a> imposes the loss on the employer without proof of negligence.</span>

The bank was entitled to the preclusion provided by former  <a href='/sections/3-405.html'>Section 3‑405(1)(c)</a> if it took the check in good faith. The fact that the bank acted negligently did not shift the loss to the bank so long as the bank acted in good faith. Under revised  <a href='/sections/3-405.html'>Section 3‑405</a> the loss may be recovered from the bank to the extent the failure of the bank to exercise ordinary care contributed to the loss.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">Case #1. Janitor, an employee of Employer, steals a check for a very large amount payable to Employer after finding it on a desk in one of Employer’s offices. Janitor forges Employer’s indorsement on the check and obtains payment. Since Janitor was not entrusted with “responsibility” with respect to the check,  <a href='/sections/3-405.html'>Section 3‑405</a> does not apply.  <a href='/sections/3-406.html'>Section 3‑406</a> might apply to this case. The issue would be whether Employer was negligent in safeguarding the check. If not, Employer could assert that the indorsement was forged and bring an action for conversion against the depositary or payor bank under  <a href='/sections/3-420.html'>Section 3‑420</a>.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">Case #2. X is Treasurer of Corporation and is authorized to write checks on behalf of Corporation by signing X’s name as Treasurer. X draws a check in the name of Corporation and signs X’s name as Treasurer. The check is made payable to X. X then indorses the check and obtains payment. Assume that Corporation did not owe any money to X and did not authorize X to write the check. Although the writing of the check was not authorized, Corporation is bound as drawer of the check because X had authority to sign checks on behalf of Corporation. This result follows from agency law and  <a href='/sections/3-402.html'>Section 3‑402(a)</a>.  <a href='/sections/3-405.html'>Section 3‑405</a> does not apply in this case because there is no forged indorsement. X was payee of the check so the indorsement is valid.  Section 3-110(a).</span>

                    <span class="" style="">Case #3. The duties of Employee, a bookkeeper, include posting the amounts of checks payable to Employer to the accounts of the drawers of the checks. Employee steals a check payable to Employer which was entrusted to Employee and forges Employer’s indorsement. The check is deposited by Employee to an account in Depositary Bank which Employee opened in the same name as Employer, and the check is honored by the drawee bank. The indorsement is effective as Employer’s indorsement because Employee’s duties include processing checks for bookkeeping purposes. Thus, Employee is entrusted with “responsibility” with respect to the check. Neither Depositary Bank nor the drawee bank is liable to Employer for conversion of the check. The same result follows if Employee deposited the check in the account in Depositary Bank without indorsement.  Section 4-205(a). Under subsection (c) deposit in a depositary bank in an account in a name substantially similar to that of Employer is the equivalent of an indorsement in the name of Employer.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">Case #4. Employee’s duties include stamping Employer’s unrestricted blank indorsement on checks received by Employer and depositing them in Employer’s bank account. After stamping Employer’s unrestricted blank indorsement on a check, Employee steals the check and deposits it in Employee’s personal bank account.  <a href='/sections/3-405.html'>Section 3‑405</a> doesn’t apply because there is no forged indorsement. Employee is authorized by Employer to indorse Employer’s checks. The fraud by Employee is not the indorsement but rather the theft of the indorsed check. Whether Employer has a cause of action against the bank in which the check was deposited is determined by whether the bank had notice of the breach of fiduciary duty by Employee. The issue is determined under  <a href='/sections/3-307~P.html'>Section 3‑307</a>.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">Case #5. The computer that controls Employer’s check-writing machine was programmed to cause a check to be issued to Supplier Co. to which money was owed by Employer. The address of Supplier Co. was included in the information in the computer. Employee is an accounts payable clerk whose duties include entering information into the computer. Employee fraudulently changed the address of Supplier Co. in the computer data bank to an address of Employee. The check was subsequently produced by the check-writing machine and mailed to the address that Employee had entered into the computer. Employee obtained possession of the check, indorsed it in the name of Supplier Co, and deposited it to an account in Depositary Bank which Employee opened in the name “Supplier Co.” The check was honored by the drawee bank. The indorsement is effective under  <a href='/sections/3-405.html'>Section 3‑405(b)</a> because Employee’s duties allowed Employee to supply information determining the address of the payee of the check. An employee that is entrusted with duties that enable the employee to determine the address to which a check is to be sent controls the disposition of the check and facilitates forgery of the indorsement. The employer is held responsible. The drawee may debit the account of Employer for the amount of the check. There is no breach of warranty by Depositary Bank under  <a href='/sections/3-417.html'>Section 3‑417(a)(1)</a> or  4-208(a)(1).</span>

                    <span class="" style="">Case #6. Treasurer is authorized to draw checks in behalf of Corporation. Treasurer draws a check of Corporation payable to Supplier Co., a company that sold goods to Corporation. The check was issued to pay the price of these goods. At the time the check was signed Treasurer had no intention of stealing the check. Later, Treasurer stole the check, indorsed it in the name “Supplier Co.” and obtained payment by depositing it to an account in Depositary Bank which Treasurer opened in the name “Supplier Co.”. The indorsement is effective under  <a href='/sections/3-405.html'>Section 3‑405(b)</a>.  <a href='/sections/3-404.html'>Section 3‑404(b)</a> does not apply to this case.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">Case #7. Checks of Corporation are signed by Treasurer in behalf of Corporation as drawer. Clerk’s duties include the preparation of checks for issue by Corporation. Clerk prepares a check payable to the order of Supplier Co. for Treasurer’s signature. Clerk fraudulently informs Treasurer that the check is needed to pay a debt owed to Supplier Co, a company that does business with Corporation. No money is owed to Supplier Co. and Clerk intends to steal the check. Treasurer signs it and returns it to Clerk for mailing. Clerk does not indorse the check but deposits it to an account in Depositary Bank which Clerk opened in the name “Supplier Co.”. The check is honored by the drawee bank.  <a href='/sections/3-404.html'>Section 3‑404(b)(i)</a> does not apply to this case because Clerk, under  Section 3-110(a), is not the person whose intent determines to whom the check is payable. But  <a href='/sections/3-405.html'>Section 3‑405</a> does apply and it treats the deposit by Clerk as an effective indorsement by Clerk because Clerk was entrusted with responsibility with respect to the check. If Supplier Co. is a fictitious person  <a href='/sections/3-404.html'>Section 3‑404(b)(ii)</a> applies. But the result is the same. Clerk’s deposit is treated as an effective indorsement of the check whether Supplier Co. is a fictitious or a real person or whether money was or was not owing to Supplier Co. The drawee bank may debit the account of Corporation for the amount of the check and there is no breach of warranty by Depositary Bank under  <a href='/sections/3-417.html'>Section 3‑417(1)(a)</a>.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">4. The last sentence of subsection (b) is similar to subsection (d) of  <a href='/sections/3-404.html'>Section 3‑404</a> which is discussed in Comment 3 to  <a href='/sections/3-404.html'>Section 3‑404</a>. In Case #5, Case #6, or Case #7 the depositary bank may have failed to exercise ordinary care when it allowed the employee to open an account in the name “Supplier Co.,” to deposit checks payable to “Supplier Co.” in that account, or to withdraw funds from that account that were proceeds of checks payable to Supplier Co. Failure to exercise ordinary care is to be determined in the context of all the facts relating to the bank’s conduct with respect to the bank’s collection of the check. If the trier of fact finds that there was such a failure and that the failure substantially contributed to loss, it could find the depositary bank liable to the extent the failure contributed to the loss. The last sentence of subsection (b) can be illustrated by an example. Suppose in Case #5 that the check is not payable to an obscure “Supplier Co.” but rather to a well-known national corporation. In addition, the check is for a very large amount of money. Before depositing the check, Employee opens an account in Depositary Bank in the name of the corporation and states to the person conducting the transaction for the bank that Employee is manager of a new office being opened by the corporation. Depositary Bank opens the account without requiring Employee to produce any resolutions of the corporation’s board of directors or other evidence of authorization of Employee to act for the corporation. A few days later, the check is deposited, the account is credited, and the check is presented for payment. After Depositary Bank receives payment, it allows Employee to withdraw the credit by a wire transfer to an account in a bank in a foreign country. The trier of fact could find that Depositary Bank did not exercise ordinary care and that the failure to exercise ordinary care contributed to the loss suffered by Employer. The trier of fact could allow recovery by Employer from Depositary Bank for all or part of the loss suffered by Employer.</span>
