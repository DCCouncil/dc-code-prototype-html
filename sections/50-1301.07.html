Service of such process shall be made by leaving a copy of the process with a fee of $2 in the hands of the Mayor or in his office, and such service shall be sufficient service upon the said nonresident; provided, that notice of such service and a copy of the summons and complaint are forthwith sent by certified mail without return receipt requested by the plaintiff, or his attorney, to the defendant at his last known address. The plaintiff has a duty to exercise due diligence in the investigation of the last known address of the defendant. The court in which the action is pending may order such continuances as may be necessary to afford the defendant a reasonable opportunity to defend the action, and no judgment by default in any such action shall be granted until at least 20 days shall have elapsed after attempted service upon the defendant, as hereinabove provided, of a copy of the process and notice of service of said process upon the Mayor.</span>
