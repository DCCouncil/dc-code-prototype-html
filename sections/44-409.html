(c), inserted “for expedited administrative review,” following “renewal applications,”, and deleted the last sentence which read: “The SHPDA develop special review procedures for proposed capital expenditures not directly related to patient care but which will increase the cost of patient care by more than 1%.”; rewrote subsec. (d)(2); in subsec. (e), deleted “which contradicts the recommendation of the SHCC” following “any decision”; and, in subsec. (f), added a new sentence which read; “The SHPDA is authorized to charge reasonable fees for the costs of providing to the public documents covered under this subsection.” Prior to amendment, subsec. (d)(2) had read as follows: “(2) The SHPDA shall issue its determination on an application for a certificate of need within 90 days after the date that the application is deemed complete or is considered complete pursuant to subsection (d)(1) of this section, or, in the case of complete review, 90 days after all applications to be considered during the review period are received. If the SHPDA cannot issue its determination within that period, the review period may be extended for one additional period of 30 days.”</span>
