One-fourth of the voting membership of the steering committee shall consist of Governors, one-fourth shall consist of Legislators, and the remainder shall consist of other members of the Commission. A Federal representative on the Commission may serve with the steering committee, but without vote. The voting members of the steering committee shall serve for terms of two years, except that members elected to the first steering committee of the Commission shall be elected as follows: sixteen for one year and sixteen for two years. The chairman, vice chairman, and treasurer of the Commission shall be members of the steering committee and, anything in this paragraph to the contrary notwithstanding, shall serve during the continuance in these offices. Vacancies in the steering committee shall not affect its authority to act, but the Commission at its next regularly ensuing meeting following the occurrence of any vacancy shall fill it for the unexpired term.
