Fees or other charges shall be so fixed and adjusted in respect of the aggregate of fees or other charges form the airports as to provide a fund sufficient with other revenues, if any, (1) to pay the cost of maintaining, repairing and operating the airports, (2) to pay the principal of and interest on bonds as they become due and payable, and (3) to create reserves for these purposes.
