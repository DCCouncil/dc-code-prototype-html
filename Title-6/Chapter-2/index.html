To allow the Board to meet and entertain any proposed action, there must be a quorum present, which shall consist of 5 Commissioners. The public notice requirement of this subsection shall not preclude the holding of an emergency meeting of the Board if the meeting is deemed by the Chairperson to be necessary. If a proposed action concerns a personnel matter, a claim or contract in negotiation, or some other matter of a sensitive nature, the Board may adjourn its public session to discuss the matter in an executive session, but must return to its public session to vote on the matter.</span>
